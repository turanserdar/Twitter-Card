## Project Overview
The Twitter Card Character Counter simulates a Twitter post creation box where users can input text, view privacy settings, and select icons to enrich their post. A character counter displays the number of characters typed, turning red if the limit is exceeded to signal an overflow.

This project was built to practice front-end development skills, especially in dynamic styling with JavaScript and CSS.
